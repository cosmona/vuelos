Most restrictions have been eased following the end of the state of alarm in May 2021. In December 2021, however, in response to the Omicron COVID-19 variant and an increase in the number of new cases, some domestic and entry restrictions were tightened. As of mid-April, at least 86 percent of the population have been fully vaccinated, restrictions have been gradually eased in most regions and international travel is allowed from all countries.</p>",
